Hello, welcome to the OCR Language Recognition **alpha attempt** by Shruthi and Shwetha.

The **ocrtut** folder contains the code and relevant template files. Comments in the code indicate the parameters that can be tweaked to obtain different results.

#Requirements: 
#1.python 2.7
#2.opencv version 2 (cv2)

#Code
To run the code, type the following at the cmd prompt:
python ocrtut.py

#When asked for input, please provide the input with explicit double quotes i.e "tim1.jpg" and not just tim1.jpg .
If you changed the parameters *e.g perimeter* , the number of contour segments will vary, and it will take longer to run in proportion to the number of segments it is trying to match. 

This folder also contains a sample output for the input tim1.jpg which can be found at *output1.txt*

In addition, there are some example images of how the contours obtained differ with different parameters to the findContours function. 

The **Screenshots** folder contains some images of the outputs -- the contours, the recognition of a particular letter, etc -- that we found promising... to give you a clear picture of what we tried out.

Thank you!
